7:T48d,Certainly. Every image delivered is post processed with our aesthetic and intricate basic post product style. This comes in the form of cropping, colour correction, exposure/ brightness adjustment, selective white and black processing, clarity adjustments, tone mapping to mention but a few. Quite a number of photographers only process selected images, if not any, from your wedding. This means you may have not too picturesque and flawed photos. However, high-end retouched images per wedding is a maximum of 60 images, relative to the chosen package(R#), where R# indicates the number of retouched images edited and presented to our clients. Retouching means the focus of our editing is moved from the general look of your photograph to the various elements within the picture. Explaining further, this means that certain flaws are noticed on the subjects within the image such as messed up hair. Furthermore, additional photographs, filters and colour grading can be added to the photograph as and when needed, to produce an outstanding image. It's as though this is the ideal and perfect picture used for wall frames, album covers, and social media blog posts.8:T470,Well, yes and no. Images captured by us do not automatically feature on our socials and blogs. Not all captured photos are featured, as we reserve the right to curate and feature certain images on our socials, per our discretion. Both clients and creators have equal rights to images to share and duplicate them. This is as a result of a provision under the copyright law which is deemed as shared ownership. Full copyright to images can however be requested by a client at a fee. Alba will subsequently and consequently have no right to share, reproduce or commercialise such images without explicit client approval. We however see sharing your photos on our socials as an avenue to communicate our prowess and mastery in our chosen field of service all the while showing captivating and breathtaking moments of your memories. Time, effort and dedication is put into capturing such moments, and showcasing such detailed and dexterous works of beauty is the nectar that attracts our clientele, most especially you. We therefore reserve the right to showcase images we curate with or without the consent of our clients as a shared owner.0:{"buildId":"1eAasx6UShTE0jQ0zbgvk","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","main",null,{"className":"min-h-screen flex flex-col pt-24","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","section",null,{"className":"flex-1 py-12 px-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-3xl mx-auto space-y-12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"text-center space-y-4","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl md:text-5xl font-light tracking-tight","children":"Terms & FAQ"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-muted-foreground text-lg italic","children":"Essential Information & Common Questions"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-8","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"bg-card border border-border rounded-lg p-6 md:p-10 shadow-sm","children":[["$","h2",null,{"className":"text-2xl font-light mb-6 tracking-wide","children":"Frequently Asked Questions"}],["$","$L3",null,{"type":"single","collapsible":true,"className":"w-full","children":[["$","$L4",null,{"value":"item-1","children":[["$","$L5",null,{"className":"text-left","children":"How long will it take to receive our product?"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap","children":"We may however choose to share some highlights as and when progress is made in the interim, that is within the post production process.
